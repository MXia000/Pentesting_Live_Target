# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL injection
  - SQL injection is found under the find salesperson page with any salesperson selected. Then with       
  https://35.184.88.145/blue/public/salesperson.php?id=1, the id number can be injected with ' OR SLEEP(5)=0--' etc.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation
  - By using the old session ID from previous login user, the attacker is able to login as authenticated user without password.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration
  - When the username is correct, the error message is bold. Otherwise, it's plain.
  - In view page source for green target, when the username is incorrect, the class is failed. If username is correct, the class is failure. But for other two targets, the class is always same which is failure no matter the username is correct or not.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - XSS can be injected in contact page when sending feedback. When admin checks the feedback, the stored XSS is activated.
